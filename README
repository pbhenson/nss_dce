DCE Naming Services for Solaris/Linux version 3.1
-------------------------------------------------

Introduction
------------

nss_dce is a package that integrates DCE into the naming services switch
architecture under Solaris/Linux. It allows you to specify "dce" as a
source in the /etc/nsswitch.conf file for passwd, shadow and group
lookups, removing the need to duplicate your security registry in local
passwd and group files.


Installation
------------

If you wish to change the compiler used (defaults to gcc) or enable
debugging, edit the Makefile. Turning on debugging in the daemon enables
verbose debugging output via syslog with priority DEBUG. Turning on
debugging in the shared library will generate messages to stderr when
clients use the naming service. Please note that if you change the default
C compiler under Solaris, you will likely need to edit the Makefile in the
nss_dce.so directory and modify the options for generating position
independent code and shared libraries.

Typing "make" will compile the shared library, the daemon, and some test
programs.

Modify your /etc/nsswitch.conf file to include "dce" as a source for
passwd and group information. For example,

  passwd:     files dce
  shadow:     files dce   (Linux only)
  group:      files dce


When you're ready to install the naming services, type "make install".
Note: you must be logged in as root for make install to succeed. This will
copy nss_dced to /usr/sbin. Under Solaris, it will copy nss_dce.so.1 to
/usr/lib. Note: this will remove Transarc's existing /usr/lib/nss_dce.so.1
symlink, which must be replaced if you want to reenable Transarc's bundled
naming services integration. Under Linux, it will copy libnss_dce.so.2 to
/lib, and create a symlink to it from /usr/lib. It will also copy an
appropriate init script to /etc/init.d. Under Solaris, the appropriate
symlinks will be created to automatically start/stop nss_dced. Under
Linux, chkconfig will be called to generate appropriate symlinks.

To help prevent failure, once nss_dced detaches from the parent process,
it spawns a child to handle naming service requests. The original nss_dced
process monitors the child, and spawns a new child if the original should
die. nss_dced logs activity to syslog via the DAEMON facility, and the ERR
and NOTICE priorities. If debugging was enabled at compile time, nss_dced
also logs detailed debugging information at the DEBUG priority.

The PID of the parent nss_dced process is logged to /var/run/nss_dced.pid.
If the parent receives either a SIGHUP or a SIGTERM, it will kill the
child and exit.

By default, sequential lookups of password, group and shadow information
are disabled for performance reasons, and the password override file
/opt/dcelocal/etc/passwd_override is respected. Sequential lookups can be
enabled and/or password overrides can be disabled via command-line
options. Typically, the DFS PAG requires one group entry slot, and nss_dced
will reserve one slot by default. If the PAG under your operating system
is not stored in a group slot or you are acquiring group information
from additional sources, you can specify the number of group slots to
reserve. See the man page for further details.

It is recommended that the naming services cache daemon (nscd) be used
to increase performance. This service runs by default under Solaris,
but is disabled by default under Linux. Depending on the size of your
cell, you might want to consider tuning the cache configuration.


Shadow Support Details
----------------------

nss_dce supports the getspnam/getspent naming service functions. These
functions return data in the following structure, as defined in shadow.h:

          struct spwd{
                  char *sp_namp;          /* login name */
                  char *sp_pwdp;          /* encrypted passwd */
                  long sp_lstchg;         /* date of last change */
                  long sp_min;            /* min days to passwd change */
                  long sp_max;            /* max days to passwd change*/
                  long sp_warn;           /* warning period */
                  long sp_inact;          /* max days inactive */
                  long sp_expire;         /* account expiry date */
                  unsigned long sp_flag;  /* not used */
          };


The following describes the mapping used by nss_dce to provide this data
for a given account:

    sp_namp     DCE principal name

    sp_pwdp     passwd field of sec_rgy_acct_user_t structure as returned
                by sec_rgy_account_lookup

    sp_lstchg   passwd_dtm field of sec_rgy_acct_user_t structure as
                returned by sec_rgy_account_lookup converted to days

    sp_min      NSS_DCED_SP_MIN defined at compile time in nss_dced.h,
                defaults to -1

    sp_max      passwd_lifetime field of sec_rgy_plcy_t structure as
                returned by sec_rgy_plcy_get_info. Note that this is
                the general registry policy, and does not reflect any
                specific policy that might apply to the given principal.
                If policy lookup fails, it uses NSS_DCED_PASSWD_LIFETIME
                defined at compile time in nss_dced.h, which defaults
                to 0

    sp_warn     NSS_DCED_SP_WARN defined at compile time in nss_dced.h,
                defaults to -1

    sp_inact    NSS_DCED_SP_INACT defined at compile time in nss_dced.h,
                defaults to -1

    sp_expire   expiration_date field of sec_rgy_acct_admin_t structure
                as returned by sec_rgy_account_lookup converted to days

    sp_flag     unused, set to 0


nss_dce allows any user to make getsp* calls to acquire shadow entries for
DCE principals, unlike the shadow file backend, which allows only root to
retrieve shadow entries. By default, the DCE security registry does not
return a Unix-format hashed password. The registry can be configured to
return the hashed password, which would allow complete plug-and-play
support for applications that authenticate via the shadow password
interface. However, enabling return of hashed passwords from the registry
will allow any user to acquire them through getsp* calls as well as
through rgy_edit, dcecp, or direct use of the DCE security API. Generally,
this has undesirable security implications.


Changes
-------

Version 3.1

     - Added Linux RPM spec contributed by Eric J Barkie <ebarkie@us.ibm.com>
       to source distribution.

     - Added Linux binary RPM to distribution site.


Version 3.0

     - Added support for Linux.

     - Converted most compile-time options to run-time options, to better
       support binary distributions.

     - Delete nss_dced.pid file on daemon exit.

     - Added man page.

     - Revamped initialization scripts.


Version 2.6

     - Added support for password overrides. The passwd_override
       file is consulted for both password and shadow lookups,
       and can override the uid, gid, password, gecos field, home
       directory, or shell. This feature can be disabled at compile
       time if desired. Thanks to Louis Langholtz <ldl@chpc.utah.edu>
       for suggestion and sample code.
        

Version 2.5

     - Added support for shadow backend. Be sure to read the section of
       this README about shadow support for implementation details and
       security implications.


Version 2.1

     - Modified nss_dced to always leave at least one group slot open for
       the DFS PAG. Note that if groups are supplied by other naming
       sources than DCE, you might still fill up all available group slots.


Version 2.0

     - Updates for Solaris 2.6. This version introduces no functional
       changes, only new compiler flags appropriate for Solaris 2.6. This
       version should not be used with Solaris 2.5[.1].


Version 1.6

     - This release is dedicated to Paul Hilchey <hilchey@ucs.ubc.ca>, who
       suggested all of the following fixes/improvements.

     - Fixed memory management problem in client, which was occasionally
       causing corrupted entries to be returned if nscd was running.

     - Added check in the client to see if the PID of the calling process
       is the same as the PID of the process that instantiated this
       client. If not, create a new connection to the daemon. Inheritance
       of connections from parent to children was causing problems with
       cron.

     - Added compile-time option to disable sequential passwd/group lookups
       (getpwent, getgrent). By default the option disables sequential
       lookups. To enable them, edit the Makefile before compiling.

     - Revamped client to remove redundant code.


Version 1.5

     - Turned nss_dced into a true daemon. It now detaches from its parent
       process and controlling terminal and runs in the background. Thanks
       to Mark Horn <mhorn@funb.com> for the suggestion.

     - Added support for group membership requests, allowing initgroups()
       to function correctly. Previous versions of nss_dce failed to return
       the supplementary group membership information, preventing
       initialization of the group list. Thanks to Martin Arlt
       <arlt@dik.maschinenbau.tu-darmstadt.de> for pointing out this
       deficiency.

     - Added syslog support to nss_dced, in place of previous stderr based
       logging. nss_dced will log errors and problems via the facility
       DAEMON and the priorities ERR and NOTICE. If debugging is enabled at
       compile time, nss_dced will also log debugging information via the
       priority DEBUG.

     - Increased fault tolerance of nss_dced. nss_dced will now spawn a
       child to handle naming service requests, and monitor that child
       for failure. If the child dies or exits, nss_dced will spawn a new
       child and log the failure. If children are respawning too rapidly,
       nss_dced will sleep for a period to avoid causing a high system
       load. Sending a SIGHUP or SIGTERM to the parent will cause it to
       kill the child and exit cleanly. The parent logs its PID to
       /opt/dcelocal/var/security/.nss_dced.pid.

     - Included S15-80nss_dced script to start nss_dced at boot.


Version 1.1

     - Modified DCE registry calls to use the default handle rather than
       explicitly binding to a particular server. The default handle is
       automatically maintained by the RPC backend, and will transparently
       rebind if the current security server fails. This should increase
       the reliability and fault tolerance of nss_dced.

     - Minor optimizations to code and protocol.

     - New test programs that more closely mirror the underlying libc calls.


Version 1.0

     - Moved default socket location from /tmp to /opt/dcelocal/var/security
       for security reasons. (Thanks to Ben Cox of Transarc for suggestion)

     - Added check to avoid potential buffer overflow in nss_dced if a
       malicious client passed an oversize query string.

     - Cleaned up error handling in nss_dced, which wasn't handling
       unexpected errors (in particular sec_rgy_not_authorized) very
       well.


Version 0.5

     - First publicly released version.
